In this section you can find two projects which works with linear regression and logistic regression technics.</br>
</br>
"Tabular playground 2021 linear regression" project presents a solution for a Kaggle competition assigment, where you </br>
can use linear regression. Straight Line might only give "good" predictions, and not "great" predictions, but they will be </br> 
consistently good predictions. Straight line has relatively low variance, because the sum of squares are very similar for </br>
different datasets. Competitors has to predict a continuous target based on a number of feature columns </br>
given in the data. All of the feature columns, cont1 - cont14 are continuous. The test set is realtively large with </br>
200000 rows. I Used Pytorch libary for building the linear regression model. I built an accuracy metric function into  </br>
the modell giving -/+20% range leeway for the predicted values compared to the target values.</br>
