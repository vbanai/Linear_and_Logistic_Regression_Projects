In this section you can find two projects which works with linear regression and logistic regression technics.</br>
</br>
"Tabular playground 2021 linear regression" project presents a solution for a Kaggle competition assigment, where  </br>
you can use linear regression. Straight Line might only give "good" predictions, and not "great" predictions,  </br> 
but they will be consistently good predictions. Straight line has relatively low variance, because the sum of  </br>
squares are very similar for different datasets. Competitors has to predict a continuous target based on a  </br>
number of feature columns given in the data. All of the feature columns, cont1 - cont14 are continuous.  </br>
The test set is realtively large with 200000 rows. I Used Pytorch libary for building the linear regression  </br>
 model. I built an accuracy metric function into the modell giving -/+20% range leeway for the predicted values </br>
compared to the target values.</br>
